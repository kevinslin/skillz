"# My Project Agents

This file contains configuration for AI agents working on this project.

## Project Context

This is a Python web application built with FastAPI and React.

## Additional Instructions

You now have access to Skills. Skills are specialized instruction sets stored as markdown files that extend your capabilities. When a task matches a skill's purpose, load and follow that skill's instructions.

### Skill Structure

Each skill contains:
- **SKILL.md**: Core instructions with YAML frontmatter
- **scripts/**: Optional executable code for deterministic tasks
- **references/**: Optional detailed documentation
- **assets/**: Optional templates, images, or files

### How to Use Skills

1. **Match task to skill**: Check the skill list below for relevant descriptions
2. **Load the skill**: Read the SKILL.md file when needed
3. **Follow instructions**: Apply the skill's guidelines exactly
4. **Use resources**: Reference bundled scripts/docs/assets as directed
5. **Combine skills**: Use multiple skills together when appropriate

### When to Load a Skill

- Task matches a skill's description
- User mentions a skill by name
- Task requires specialized knowledge (file formats, workflows, domain expertise)

### Key Principles

- **Load only when needed** - Don't load skills for simple tasks
- **Apply naturally** - Don't announce "loading skill X" unless relevant
- **Use bundled resources** - Scripts and references are there to help
- **Be precise** - Skills often include exact patterns and code to follow

### Available Skills

Below is the list of skills you can access. Load a skill by reading its SKILL.md file when the task matches:

- [python-expert](.claude/skills/python-expert/SKILL.md): Expert Python development assistance with best practices, testing, and modern Python features
- [react-patterns](.claude/skills/react-patterns/SKILL.md): Modern React patterns including hooks, composition, performance optimization, and TypeScript integration
